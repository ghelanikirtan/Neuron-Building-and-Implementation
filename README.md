# Overview:
- This repo categorizes skin cancer types: **benign & malignment** using Artificial Neural Networks.
- The main aim of this classification is the implementation of how **Neuron** operates in the Neural networks mathematically.
- **So, here I haven't used any Pre-built ML model libraries (Sklearn/pytorch/tensorflow...).**
- Only importing libraries helpful in **Pre-processing and Plotting**.

## #1. ANN From Scratch:

- This notebook contains the basic operation of a **neuron** in a neural network mathematically.

## #2. Skin_Cancer_prediction:

- In this notebook, I am trying to implement the above-built **NEURON** to operate on large image datasets regarding skin cancer.
- Work-In-Progress ⚠️
