# Overview:

- This repo categorizes skin cancer types: **benign & malignment** using Artificial Neural Networks.
- The main aim of this classification is the implementation of how **Neuron** operates in the Neural networks mathematically👨‍🔬.
- **So, here I have NOT used any Pre-built ML model libraries (Sklearn/pytorch/tensorflow...) 🚫**.
- Only importing libraries helpful in **Pre-processing and Plotting**.

## 1. ANN From Scratch:

- This notebook contains the basic operation of a **neuron** in a neural network mathematically.
- In short: 🔨 Building a **NEURON**. 

## 2. Skin_Cancer_prediction:

- In this notebook, I am trying to implement the above-built **NEURON** to operate on large image datasets regarding skin cancer.
- Work-In-Progress ⚠️



*!Keep Building...* 😜
